# Credit Card Default Prediction

This project applies data science and machine learning techniques to predict whether a customer will default on their credit card payment next month. The dataset is sourced from a real-world credit dataset and includes demographic, billing, and payment information.

## Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization
- Feature selection using correlation and RFE
- Handling imbalanced data with undersampling
- Model training using Random Forest with custom thresholds
- Performance evaluation using precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix
- Feature importance ranking and retraining with top features

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Imbalanced-learn
- Jupyter/Colab (originally written in notebook format)
